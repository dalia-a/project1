## My Code Story:
* Day 1: Break the project to steps and begin with the simplest steps, structure the project with HTML.
* Day 2: Design the project with CSS and declare the variable like : array for boxs, player X ,player O and created play function in app.js using jQuery .
* Day 3: Continued created play function and prevent the player to chosse the box twice , show the player message who turn to play, also Created winnerFunction to check every row and column and diagonal with boxs to check the winner, prevent user to choose box when one of user win  and show sweet alert when the user win and when no one win .
* Day 4: created the reset function to play new game and this the hardest part because the color of winner in boxs didn't remove the color  when player play a new game , and i craeted soundFunction  to make sound when player win or tie and that the easiest part of all function , add responsive  to playable from a mobile phone 
* Day 5 : presentation of tic tac toe Game.
